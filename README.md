What adjustments need to be made? / *What additional data needs to be collected to train a generalized model for primary schools?*


*How will you collect, process,and validate this data?*


### Question 2:

#### With technical scalability in mind:

*What kind of support andmaintenance would be necessary to ensure the tool remains up-to-date and useful for primary schools over time?*


*What problems do you foresee?*


### Question 3:

#### How would you ensure that this model is reusable for other(similar) applications?
